Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL queries and scripts that demonstrate my ability to utilize SQL in different scenarios and for various purposes. Feel free to look around and let me know if you have any questions.

## Introduction
In this repository, you will find a collection of SQL projects and exercises I have worked on. Each project folder contains SQL scripts, explanations, and, where applicable, data files or links to data sources.
